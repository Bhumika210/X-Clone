# X-Clone
Welcome to the Twitter Clone project! This project is a simple, static representation of a Twitter-like social media platform, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The aim of this project is to provide users with a lightweight, interactive experience that mimics some core functionalities of Twitter without the complexity of a backend system.
